   Failure to pay the balloon amount entitles the Owner to repossess
   the vehicle immediately without refund of prior payments.

5. REPOSSESSION CLAUSE
   IMMEDIATE REPOSSESSION: In the event the Hirer misses any single
   instalment payment, or any payment is dishonoured, the Owner is
   entitled to repossess the vehicle IMMEDIATELY without prior notice
   and without any court order.
   Repossession agents are authorised to enter any premises where
   the vehicle is located to effect repossession.
   The Hirer shall bear all repossession costs including towing,
   storage, and administrative fees.
   Upon repossession, the vehicle shall be sold at auction. Any
   shortfall between the auction price and the outstanding balance
   shall remain the personal debt of the Hirer.

   Late payment charge: 8% of the monthly instalment for each
   month or part thereof that payment remains outstanding.
   Late charges compound monthly on the outstanding overdue amount.
   No grace period is provided.

   The Hirer may settle the outstanding balance at any time subject
   to an early settlement penalty of 4% of the original financed
   amount (RM 108,000), amounting to RM 4,320.00, regardless of
   how early or late in the tenure settlement occurs.

   from MCK Auto Finance's panel insurer only: SafeGuard Assurance Bhd.
   Annual premium (estimated): RM 3,800.00 — to be financed and added
   to the monthly instalment in year 1 and each renewal year.

   default immediately.
